# Scene-Understanding-Computer-Vision
### Scene Understanding for 3D Dynamic Scenes  Real-time scene understanding uses sensors like cameras to interpret 3D scenes. It involves detecting, recognizing, and predicting interactions, adapting to new environments, and communicating insights. This project enhances these capabilities for robust and adaptable analysis.
